# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
> In my opinion, the Project goals are practice and demonstrate Tableau skills we 
learned so far. Ability to work with Data Sources and generate visualiaions in the way that it is 
understandable for the general public

## Process
### First Step was to upload all the Data Sources to the Tableau.
> I chose Option 1 and uploaded next datasets, which are available in the Canadian Open Data portal:

> 1. Housing_price_index
> 2. Office_realestate_index
> 3. Consumer_index
> 4. real_estate_prices
> 5. real_estate_numbers
> 6. weekly_earnings
### The next step was to execute all the tasks

## Results

> - In this excercise I showed the trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years. Analisis shows that the average house prices have shown a notable increase from the beginning of the analysis period to the present day

> - In Next excercise was to compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices. Benchmark prices serve as reference points for the real estate market. From the analisis we can see that The Benchmark prices are lower in the beginning of the graph (2005). Howerer, by 2020 th Benchmark price are much more accurate and matching actual prices. 

> - Next was to compare the trend with the trend of office prices. The dynamics between the residential and commercial real estate markets starting from early 90s is pretty much same, however, we can see significant growth of the residential real estate market in 2020 

> - In next exercise I created a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district. 

> - Next I compare the trend of house prices with earnings. According to graphs I can see that people spend more earning in 2014 than in 2005. 

> - In the next exercise I checked effect of several economic crises on below factors. We can see fall on both the residential and commercial real estate markets. On other hand Earning have stable dynamic growth over the years. 
 * Earnings
 * House prices
 * Office prices
 * House constructions
 * Consumer index

> - In this exercise, I ploted consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. We can predict the consumer_index from the housing_price_index. The p-value of "< 0.0001" suggests that the relationship between the housing_price_index and the consumer_index is statistically significant, meaning that the changes in the housing_price_index are associated with changes in the consumer_index in a meaningful way.
We have Index Value = 0.89512 * Total (house and land) + 37.2894," represents a linear regression equation. It implies that the consumer_index is predicted based on the housing_price_index with a coefficient of 0.89512 and an intercept of 37.2894.


## Challenges 
> The first challemge was to upload Data Sources correctly, so I could work with all of them simultaneously.
> Another challenge was to understand which variable to use and when. 
> It was also tricky to find out that Dates were with String type

## Future Goals
> If I have more time, I would play with details, colours of the visualizations.
